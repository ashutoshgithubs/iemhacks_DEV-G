We welcome contributions from participants of the GSSOC'24 program! Below are some guidelines to help you get started:

### Issue Labels

We have categorized our issues and labeled them with appropriate tags to help contributors find tasks that match their skills and interests. For GSSoC'24 participants, we have included specific labels indicating the difficulty level of each issue:

- `gssoc`: Indicates that the issue is suitable for GSSoC'24 participants.
- `level1`: Represents beginner-friendly tasks with minimal complexity.
- `level2`: Represents intermediate-level tasks with moderate complexity.
- `level3`: Represents advanced tasks with higher complexity.

Please feel free to explore our list of issues and choose one that aligns with your skills and interests. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

- **Suggesting Changes**: If you would like to suggest entirely new website content or code, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ashutoshgithubs/iemhacks_DEV-G/issues) to discuss it first.

## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and feature requests. Feel free to open an issue over [here](https://github.com/ashutoshgithubs/iemhacks_DEV-G/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented.

Please include images and browser-specific information if the bug is related to some visual aspect of the site. This tends to make it easier to reproduce and fix.

## Git and GitHub Workflow

The preferred workflow for contributing to a repository is to fork the main repository on GitHub, clone and develop on a new branch.

If you aren't familiar with how to work with Github or would like to learn it, here is [a great tutorial](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

Feel free to use any approach while creating a PR. Here are a few suggestions from our team:

- If you are unsure whether your changes will be accepted or want to discuss the method before delving into it, please create an issue and ask.
- Clone the repo locally (or continue editing directly in GitHub if the change is small). Checkout
  out the branch that you created.
- Create a draft PR with a small initial commit. Here's how you can [create a draft pull request.](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
- Continue developing and feel free to ask questions in the PR if you run into obstacles or uncertainty as you make changes.
- Review your implementation according to the checks noted in the PR template.
- Once you feel your branch is ready, change the PR status to "ready to review."
- Consult the tasks noted in the PR template.
