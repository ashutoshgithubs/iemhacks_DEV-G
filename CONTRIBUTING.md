## Contributions Guidelines <a name="guide"></a>

If you've got the coding idea and want to contribute to DEV-G EdTech's development, this section provides guidelines on how to fork the repository, create branches, and submit pull requests.

- Find  issues labeled by other contributers and the project admin.  Visit in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ashutoshgithubs/iemhacks_DEV-G/issues) to start contributing. You can also create your own issue from your end if you find such issue 

***Make Your Changes:***
-   Now you're ready to dive into the code! Open the project in your favorite code editor.
-   Make your changes to the files following the project's coding conventions. (If there are no specific conventions documented, follow common JavaScript and React best practices.)

***Test the change you made :***
-   Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and test your modifications thoroughly. Make sure your changes don't introduce any new bugs or break existing functionalities.

***Commit Your Changes:***

-   Use Git to track your changes. Stage the modified files using `git add <filename>`           (or `git add .` to stage all changes).
-   Commit your staged changes with a descriptive commit message using `git commit -m "Your informative message here"`.

***Push Your Changes to Your Fork:***

-   Push your committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using:
   
     ```  git push origin master```
    
***Create a Pull Request:***

-   Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
-   Click on the "Pull requests" tab and then "New pull request" button.
-   Select the branch containing your changes from the "Head" branch dropdown.
-   Leave the "Base" branch as "master" (assuming you're targeting the main codebase).

-   Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes for review.
